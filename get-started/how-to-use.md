## What is this book about/Objective and Approach

This is a cookbook to introduce Earth scientists to working with data
in the cloud and to provide a foundation for this work.  Like any
cookbook, it includes recipes with step-by-step instructions but it
also introduces skills and best practices that will help not only
produce a fantastic chocolate cake (or in this case scientific code)
but also allow the reader to come up with their own recipe.  We've
also included meal plans - end-to-end workflows - that put together
the recipes.  User can 'choose their own adventure' and build their
own workflows based on their need.

## Who is this book for

This book is for Earth data scientists, and other data scientists, who
want or need to migrate from the _download and analyze locally_
workflow to a _cloud-based analyze in place_ workflow.  The book
contains examples in python and R, two of the more popular scripting
languages in Earth science.  Examples and end-to-end workflows are
presented in interactive Jupyter notebooks.  Readers can clone
notebooks from the GitHub repository or run them on binder.  Or they
can just cut-and-paste code into their own scripts.

We assume some knowledge of python or R but do not expect expert-level
knowledge, because we are not experts ourselves.  We introduce
packages and APIs to help with working with data in the cloud.  Don't
worry, APIs will be explained as we go along.
