## What is this book about
This is a cookbook to introduce Earth scientists to working with data in the cloud and to provide a foundation for this work.  Like any cookbook, it includes recipes with step-by-step instructions but it also introduces skills and best practices that will help not only produce a fantastic chocolate cake (or in this case scientific code) but also allow the reader to come up with their own recipe.  We've also included meal plans - end-to-end workflows - that put together the recipes.  User can 'choose their own adventure' and build their own workflows based on their need.
